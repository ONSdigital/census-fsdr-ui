A custom search was created to allow for a horizontal search on the home screen and to make out main html pages cleaner 
and  more readable. Can revisit if a better solution can be found.

 -- Added another custom search for Interface Action Table  in the same format as the home page (index)  search format,
 which will allow n extra 2 input fields in addition to the job role, worker surname and area
